# PythonSortingShell ![alt text](https://travis-ci.org/DavidLSmyth/PythonSortingShell.svg?branch=master)
A project which implements various sorting algorithms which can then be benchmarked against each other. Written to practice: 

* Using github to effectively version control the project
* Investigating python class design with metaclasses, Inheritance, mixins
* Practice using python to wrap C functions to give speed boost
* Practice using CI tools such as travis
* Practice writing sorting algorithms efficiently

Written and tested using Ubuntu 16.04.
Install MinGW on windows with make and gcc in order to run on Windows. Alternatively compile the sorting library to a dll manually (visual studio compiler is probably easiest) and then modify the windows makefile correspondingly
Compiled C functions will not run on windows
