# PythonSortingShell ![alt text](https://travis-ci.org/DavidLSmyth/PythonSortingShell.svg?branch=master)
A project which implements various sorting algorithms which can then be benchmarked against each other. Written to improve following aspects of my coding ability: 

* Using github to effectively version control the project
* Investigating python metaclasses, Inheritance, mixins
* Practice using python to wrap C functions to give speed boost
* Practice using CI tools such as travis
* Practice writing sorting algorithms efficiently

Written and tested on Ubuntu 16.04. Compiled C functions will not run on windows
