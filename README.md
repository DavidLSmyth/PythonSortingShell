# PythonSortingShell ![alt text](https://travis-ci.org/DavidLSmyth/PythonSortingShell.svg?branch=master)
A project which implements various sorting algorithms which can then be benchmarked against each other. Written to practice: 

* Using github to effectively version control the project
* Investigating python class design with metaclasses, Inheritance, mixins
* Practice using python to wrap C functions to give speed boost
* Practice using CI tools such as travis
* Practice writing sorting algorithms efficiently

Written and tested using Ubuntu 16.04.

## Running the code


## Extending the project with your own sorting classes
